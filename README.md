# Welcome to the EventStoreDB's "From Scratch" series   
# <code style="color : green">Java edition</code>

Cook up your own tasty recipes by following the following examples in the "FromScratch" series:
1. .NET
2. Node.js
3. Python
4. Java

The **FromScratch** series provides practical path to learn a new framework.  Follow this thorough set of instructions and example code and successsfully complete your initial project. 

# Goals of the project 

The Event Store Academy team (link to Academy when ready) wrote these with the following design goals.

1. Solve the "Doesn't run on my machine" problem by configuring and verifying success in GitHub codespaces
2. Clearly provide and explain all dependencies
3. Include instructions to configure locally, including setting up a development environment

The From Scracth cotent intends to provide EVERYTHING you need to get started in ONE place. 

# Next Steps and Other Resources

Upon successful completion of your "From Scratch" projects, you can continue practicing with the examples located at https://github.com/EventStore/samples.

In particular, the [Quickstart examples](https://GitHub.com/EventStore/samples/tree/main/Quickstart) contain more thorough examples, and include content referencing Go, Spring Boot, and Rust.

# Using this repo

### 1. Start with Codespaces

A fast path to successfully running this code is to utilize GitHub codespaces.
 
For more info on codespaces please visit https://github.com/features/codespaces.

At the time of writing this all GitHub users receive 60 hours/month of free access to codespaces for non-commercial use.  As such, all you need to get started is a GitHub account.

### 2. Setting up a local environment

If you have struggled setting up a working environment to test code, you are NOT alone. Even experienced developers can find setting up a new development environment confusing and time consuming. 

After running successfully completing the steps in codespaces, you should try to set up EventStoreDB in your local environment.
1. Git clone, or download the repo and modify locally to suit your purposes
2. Follow the detailed instructions that walk through the exact steps of how we built this content **"_From Scratch_"**

# Supporting Documents
 Included in the top level directory are the required resources:
 1. A PDF [Instructions For Running in CodeSpaces](CodeSpacesInstructions.pdf) outlining the steps needed to launch codespaces
 2. A PDF [Instructions For Running Locally](InstructionsForRunningLocally.pdf) describing how to run EventStoreDB locally, including step by step details on how we built the project
 3. A PDF [Running the Java Code](RunningTheJavaCode.pdf) describing the Java files containing the code to write to and read from EventStoreDB


# Most of all have fun!  Once you know how to write and read events "From Scratch," you will be ready to cook up all sorts of tasty and more advanced recipes
