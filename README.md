# Welcome to the Java example of EvenstoreDB "FromScratch"

Cook up your own tasty recipes by following the 4 examples in the "FromScratch" series
1. dotnet
2. nodejs
3. python
4. java

The FromScratch series is designed with the understanding that at some point we all need complete, end to end instructions and example code when working with a new framework. 

# Goals of the project 

The Eventstore Academy team (link to Academy when ready) wrote these with the following design goals.

1. Solve the "Doesn't run on my machine" problem by configuring and verifying success in githib codespaces
2. Clearly provide and explain all dependencies
3. Provide instructions on configuring locally including setting up a development environment
4. Everything you need to get started in ONE place

# Next Steps and Other Resources

Once you get up and running with these examples we suggest you take a look at the many examples here

https://github.com/EventStore/samples

In particular the Quickstart examples here

https://github.com/EventStore/samples/tree/main/Quickstart

In the quickstart you will find more complete examples, and also examples using go, springboot and rust.

# Using this repo

### 1. Start with Codespaces

The quickest path to succesfully running this code is github codespaces
 
See here for more info on codespaces https://github.com/features/codespaces

At the time of writing this all github users 60 hours/month of free access to codespaces for non-commercial use. 

So all you need to get started is a github account.

### 2. Follow the included instructions to set up a local environment

If you have struggled with setting up a working environment to test code, you are NOT alone. Even experienced developers when they are hired into a new organizition find that setting up the development environment is time consuming. 

Some steps you could follow after running this in codespaces could be.
1. Git clone, or download the repo and modify locally to suit your purposes
2. Follow the detailed steps that describe exactly how we built this content **"From Scratch"**

# Supporting Documents
 Included in the top level directory are the resources you need
 1. A PDF [Instructions For Running in CodeSpaces](CodeSpacesInstructions.pdf)of the steps needed to launch codespaces
 2. A PDF [Instructions For Running Locally](InstructionsForRunningLocally.pdf) describing how to run locally, that includes step by step details on how we built the project
 3. A PDF [Running the Java Code](RunningTheJavaCode.pdf)


# Most of all have fun, and once you know how to write an EVENT From Scratch you will be ready to cook up all sorts of tasty and more advanced recipes
